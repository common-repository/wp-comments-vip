Add VIP Comments Rank into your blog's comments.

== Description ==

No one post comment in your blog?

Don't worry! This plugin can encourage more people post comment on your blog.

After your install this plugin, when visitors post comments in your blog, they will get the VIP Rank from the number of comments they have posted.

They are 7 VIP Ranks from VIP 1 to VIP 7 from this plugin. Each rank will match with limit number of comments.

And you can simply set all limit number all in the plugin's option page!

You may also use this plugin with: [WP Owner Mark](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-owner-mark/)
